# BotTemplate
Template for IntelliJ/Gradle development of JDA Discord bots

This is a bot template that I made because I was tired of redoing the same steps every time I made a new discord bot. That is all.
It has a command interface that I think is simple enough to understand with the examples provided.
Don't forget to change the values in BotConfig if you want them to be different, which you probably will, because otherwise only I will be able to shut down your bot.

Now it's compatible with Java 8, but the project is defaulted to Java 11 because I like var.
